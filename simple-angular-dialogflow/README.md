# SimpleAngularDialogflow

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Prerequisite

Create a dialogflow agent and enable small talk in it.
Copy the access token and Past the token into your environments/environment.ts file (Do not commit this)

NOTE: Your token ideally should not be in Angular. A hacker could intercept this key and make requests to your endpoint. So dont commit your token ever. Usally a routing server appends the token in your backend.
